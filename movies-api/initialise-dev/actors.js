With Florida Banjeom, a popular Chinese restaurant, comfortably settled up on the roof, people from far and wide are always running in and out of the building.\n\nBut it’s not the constant stream of guests that has Hae Won concerned; it’s the fact that the restaurant’s owner and head chef, Baek Eun Kyu, seems to have a serious problem with him. Having been recommended for a part-time job at the restaurant by Cha Ji Soo, a fellow restaurant owner, Hae Won thought he would easily fit in with the staff; but for some reason Eun Kyu seems to instantly dislike him.  Despite the fact that he can’t figure out why his boss is so bothered by him, Hae Won finds himself fitting in nicely with his fellow staff members, Ha Jin and Joo Seo Hyuk.\n\nWhat does surprise him is when he realizes that he himself has fallen. But will he ever be able to win the heart of his cold-hearted boss?",

Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.",
